        <h2>Introduction</h2>
       <p> Over the last two decades the existence of multi-quark states such as pentaquarks and tetraquarks
have been confirmed through the efforts of the LHCb, BESIII, Belle and other
collaborations. One can expect even more to be discovered in the years to come.
One of the standard theoretical methods to investigate such multi-quark states is Lattice Quantum
Chromodynamics (LQCD). As the quark content increases, however, LQCD becomes more computationally
expensive and time-intensive. A great deal of effort on theoretical setup in terms of Wick contractions,
operator selection, wave function smearing and analysis must be done. Each state must be investigated
separately and no global picture emerges. Larger systems also require larger lattices. In order to investigate
the dynamics of such exotic states, the Thomas-Fermi (TF) statistical quark model was developed as
an inexpensive alternative. We have pointed out that it could be key to identifying families of bound states,
rather than individual cases. The TF quark model has previously been applied to systems of multi-quarks
to investigate ground state properties of baryons. It has also been used to examine the bound states of
multi-quark mesons[15]. The latter paper suggested the existence of several tetra, octa, and hexadeca quark
states
